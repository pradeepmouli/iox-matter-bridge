[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

**Release-only repository** for IoX Matter Bridge: hosts packaged bridge artifacts, changelogs, and issue tracking.

## 📖 What is IoX Matter Bridge?

**IoX Matter Bridge** is a service that exposes your eisy (or ISY) home automation controller as a Matter bridge device on your Matter network. This allows you to:

- ✅ **Control eisy devices** through Matter-compatible controllers (Apple Home, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, etc.)
- ✅ **Integrate with Matter ecosystems** without replacing existing Insteon, Z-Wave, or other devices
- ✅ **Maintain local control** with secure, standards-based Matter protocol
- ✅ **Leverage existing automation** while expanding compatibility

The bridge acts as a translator between your eisy controller's devices and the Matter protocol, making your existing smart home devices accessible to Matter-enabled ecosystems.

## 📦 What is This Repository?

This repository serves as the **official distribution point** for IoX Matter Bridge releases. It contains:

- ✅ **Release artifacts** (compiled binaries, packaged distributions)
- ✅ **SBOM** (Software Bill of Materials)
- ✅ **Checksums & signatures** for verification
- ✅ **Release notes & changelog**
- ✅ **Issue tracking** for installation, deployment, and runtime issues

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation on eisy

**For stable releases (recommended):**
Stable releases are automatically available through the eisy package manager. The bridge will be installed and updated automatically via the eisy's built-in package update mechanism.

To install:
1. Navigate to the eisy admin console
2. Go to Package Manager
3. Look for "IoX Matter Bridge"
4. Click Install/Update

**For pre-releases (testing/early access):**
Pre-releases are available on this GitHub repository for testing and early access. To install a pre-release manually:

1. **Download the pre-release** from the [Releases page](https://github.com/pradeepmouli/iox-matter-bridge/releases)
   - Look for releases marked as "Pre-release"
   - Download the `.tar.gz` artifact and checksums file

2. **Verify the download:**
   ```bash
   # Replace X.Y.Z-beta.N with the pre-release version (e.g., 1.5.0-beta.1)
   VERSION="X.Y.Z-beta.N"
   sha256sum -c checksums-v${VERSION}.txt --ignore-missing
   ```

3. **Extract and install:**
   ```bash
   # Extract the archive (using the same VERSION from above)
   tar -xzf iox-matter-bridge-v${VERSION}.tar.gz
   
   # Install to eisy (follow specific installation instructions in the release notes)
   # Installation steps may vary by pre-release version
   ```

4. **Check release notes** for version-specific installation instructions and known issues

> **Note:** Pre-releases may contain experimental features and are not recommended for production use. Always back up your configuration before installing pre-releases.

### Manual Installation (Other Platforms)

For installation on non-eisy platforms (Linux, macOS):

```bash
# Download release (replace VERSION with actual version)
VERSION="1.0.0"
wget https://github.com/pradeepmouli/iox-matter-bridge/releases/download/v${VERSION}/iox-matter-bridge-v${VERSION}.tar.gz
wget https://github.com/pradeepmouli/iox-matter-bridge/releases/download/v${VERSION}/checksums-v${VERSION}.txt

# Verify integrity
sha256sum -c checksums-v${VERSION}.txt --ignore-missing

# Extract and install
tar -xzf iox-matter-bridge-v${VERSION}.tar.gz
sudo mv iox-matter-bridge /opt/iox-matter-bridge
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Bridge Not Appearing in Matter Controller

**Symptoms:** Bridge doesn't show up in Home app, Google Home, etc.

**Solutions:**
1. Verify the bridge is running:
   ```bash
   # Check service status (on eisy)
   systemctl status iox-matter-bridge
   ```

2. Check network connectivity:
   - Ensure bridge and controller are on the same network
   - Check firewall settings aren't blocking mDNS (port 5353)
   - Verify Matter/Thread network configuration

3. Restart the bridge:
   ```bash
   # On eisy
   systemctl restart iox-matter-bridge
   ```

4. Check logs for errors:
   ```bash
   # View recent logs
   journalctl -u iox-matter-bridge -n 100
   ```

#### Devices Not Updating Status

**Symptoms:** Device status in Matter controller doesn't match actual device state

**Solutions:**
1. Check eisy connection:
   - Verify bridge can communicate with eisy
   - Check eisy is responsive and devices are reporting correctly

2. Review bridge configuration:
   - Ensure eisy credentials are correct
   - Verify device polling interval settings

3. Force device refresh:
   - Toggle the device physically
   - Restart the bridge service

#### Pairing Code Not Working

**Symptoms:** QR code or pairing code rejected by Matter controller

**Solutions:**
1. Generate new pairing code:
   - Restart bridge to generate fresh pairing credentials
   - Check bridge logs for the current pairing code

2. Verify Matter controller compatibility:
   - Ensure controller firmware is up to date
   - Try pairing with a different Matter controller

3. Reset Matter credentials (if necessary):
   - Stop the bridge service
   - Remove the Matter storage directory (location varies by installation)
   - Restart the bridge to generate new pairing credentials
   - For specific instructions, check the release notes for your version or consult the [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md)

#### High CPU or Memory Usage

**Symptoms:** Bridge consuming excessive system resources

**Solutions:**
1. Check number of devices:
   - Large device count may require more resources
   - Consider filtering devices if necessary

2. Reduce polling frequency:
   - Adjust polling interval in configuration
   - Balance between responsiveness and resource usage

3. Review logs for errors:
   - Continuous errors can cause resource spikes
   - Address underlying issues causing errors

### Getting Help

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Check the logs** - Most issues have clues in the logs
2. **Search existing issues** - Someone may have had the same problem
3. **Submit a bug report** - Use the appropriate [issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/)
4. **Include all relevant information:**
   - Release version
   - Environment details
   - Complete logs (with sensitive information redacted)
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Configuration files

### Debug Logging

To enable debug logging for more detailed troubleshooting:

1. Edit the bridge configuration (location varies by installation)
2. Set log level to `debug` or `trace`
3. Restart the bridge
4. Reproduce the issue
5. Collect logs and attach to your issue report

> **Warning:** Debug logs may contain sensitive information. Always review and redact sensitive data before sharing logs publicly.
